  # Introducing the Advanced Manufacturing Research Institute
This summer, four fellows representing some of the best young talent
in advanced manufacturing have descended upon Houston to work on rapid
prototyping thrusts for one month. This all fell under a new
organization I am proud to be a part of along with Dr. Jordan Miller,
newly an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at
Rice University. Weâ€™re calling this organization AMRI: Advanced
Manufacturing Research Institute.

Jordan and I are heavily motivated in our careers by mentorship and
education. We both feel a responsibility to translate our knowledge in a
way that can be easily understood by students of all ages. The
fellowship component of AMRI presents a perfect opportunity to work with
smart, motivated young students in the maker community and arm them with
tools from the scientific community.

We hope you are able to share in our excitement about this organization
either by simply reading about it, or by joining our web broadcast of
the final talks tomorrow (details below), or even by making a
tax-deductible donation to the 501c3 institute here.
